# Level Up - Learn & Prove Your Skills

This repository contains a set of problem solving issues for programmers.

Most issues can be resolved with basic understanding of TypeScript, but some of the
issues may require understanding of technologies such as React.

The issues are described in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/showell-labs/level-up/issues) and
the related code can be found from `/issues` folder.

The issues have been written for programmers from intermediate to advanced level.

## How to Prove Your Skills

1. Make a **private fork** (within a private repository) of this repository and checkout a new branch
2. Clone on your device and run `yarn` (make sure you have `yarn` installed)
3. Resolve [each issue in this repository](https://github.com/showell-labs/level-up/issues) (or as agreed separately)
4. Make a PR using your own repository (fork) as the base repository (we don't accept PRs to this repository).
5. Submit us the link to the PR in your repository

## Good to Know

- When there's a `jest` test written for the issue, that test should be also updated to
ensure that the issue has been properly solved.

- There's usually no single truth for resolving the issue. Be creative.

- There may be issues that would require additional NPM modules to be installed in order
to fix the issues properly. It is OK to do so, but remember that there shouldn't be much
need for extra modules.

- It is OK to use any sources to resolve the issues, but you'll be only fooling yourself
if you cannot resolve the issues with your current knowledge and some basic Googling.
